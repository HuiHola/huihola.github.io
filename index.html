            <h1>Language Experience</h1>
            <ul>
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <li>With Python, I have worked extensively on automation, data analysis, and cybersecurity scripting. I have developed custom scripts to automate penetration testing tasks, such as scanning for vulnerabilities, analyzing network traffic, and cracking passwords using libraries like scapy and hashlib. My experience also includes writing tools for web scraping, data analysis using pandas, and implementing security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities. Additionally, I have leveraged Python for creating secure APIs and conducting ethical hacking practices, focusing on safeguarding systems from potential threats.</li>
                <h2>Java</h2>
                <li>In Java, I have built Android applications, most notably "FindDroid," an app that helps users locate lost phones through messaging platforms. My experience with Java includes object-oriented programming, handling asynchronous tasks, and using APIs. Additionally, I have worked on backend logic, ensuring optimal performance and security in mobile applications.</li>
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <li>With JavaScript, I have experience in both frontend and backend development, building dynamic and responsive websites. I’ve utilized frameworks like Node.js for server-side scripting and have worked with various APIs to handle data processing. My experience also includes working with RESTful APIs, asynchronous programming, and implementing client-side security measures to ensure robust web applications. I am proficient in DOM manipulation, event handling, and using JavaScript to enhance user interactions while maintaining secure web environments.</li>
                <h2>C Lang</h2>
                <li>I have worked with C primarily in system-level programming, including developing low-level applications for performance-critical tasks. My knowledge includes memory management, pointer arithmetic, and understanding data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues. I've also used C to build efficient algorithms for embedded systems and operating system tasks.</li>
                <h2>C++</h2>
                <li>In C++, my focus has been on developing performance-optimized applications using object-oriented principles. I’ve worked with advanced concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and templates, and have built custom data structures and algorithms. My experience includes optimizing code for speed and memory, and I have used C++ in competitive programming and game development projects.</li>
